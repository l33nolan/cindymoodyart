                    <p>I have been interested in the art of drawing and replication from a very early age. As a child I
                        enjoyed doodling small sketches for family and friends. As a young woman, a distinct lack of
                        opportunity left me wanting to discover more of the world of art and I held a strong personal
                        desire to develop my inner creativity. </p>
                    <p>Saltburn, is my most favourite seaside location of the English coastline, and an absolute delight
                        for an artist. Much of my inspiration comes from this area. In contrast to the natural beauty of
                        the sea, I am also intrigued by the naturally occurring urban art that can be found down
                        alleyways and streets in many cities and towns. Particularly poster art and urban decay. Living
                        in the city of Hull, I was lucky enough to study at the Hull School of Art and Design. During my
                        studies I was able to explore the use of various mediums including photography, film and
                        illustration.</p>

                <div class="c-about-container">
                    <p>I mostly paint in acrylic, due to their colour vibrancy and ease of use, I prefer a quicker
                        drying medium, although I never shy away from other forms of mark making. I take inspiration
                        from the world around me, I am interested in nature, objects and anything that visually
                        stimulates me. I always search for the beauty in any situation, I often travel and always keep a
                        look out for inspiration. </p>
                    <p>Relaxing seascapes draw me in and I love to explore the way that the elements unite to create
                        interesting and exciting forms, particularly the way that water reflects on the body. I am
                        always finding ways to return to my painting; working and travelling take up my time, but
                        immersion into the canvas is essential to feed my soul and express my inner creativity.</p>

                            popular culture, she employed a na√Øve folk art style to explore questions of identity,
                            postcolonialism, gender, class, and race in Mexican society. </p>
